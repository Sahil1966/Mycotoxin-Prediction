# Mycotoxin Prediction in Corn Using Hyperspectral Imaging

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project leverages hyperspectral imaging data to predict deoxynivalenol (DON) concentrations in corn. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit web application.

## ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation

- **RÂ² Score**: -0.269 (Model struggling to capture patterns)
- **RMSE**: 885.023 (Large prediction errors)

**Feature Importance (via SHAP Analysis):**

- Some features (e.g., 78, 123, 136) exhibit strong predictive power.
- Model struggles with extreme values and generalization.

## ðŸ”¥ Future Improvements

- âœ… Enhance feature selection and apply dimensionality reduction techniques.
- âœ… Experiment with advanced model architectures like XGBoost or CNNs tailored for spectral data.
- âœ… Address outliers and imbalanced datasets effectively.
- âœ… Deploy the application using Docker and integrate with cloud services for scalability.
